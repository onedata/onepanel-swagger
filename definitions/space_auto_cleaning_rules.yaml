  Rules used to select certain list of file replicas that can be evicted by auto-cleaning mechanism.
  A rule is enabled by setting its `enabled` field to `true`.
  By default all rules are disabled (ignored). A rule can be enabled without specifying its value.
  In that case previous value is used. If the rule is enabled for the first time a default value will be used.
  All rules' values are inclusive.
