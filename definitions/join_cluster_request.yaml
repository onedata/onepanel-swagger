      The cookie is a character sequence that is common for all the cluster
      nodes. If this parameter is not provided, in case of a cluster
      initialization request, it will be generated, and in case of a cluster
      extension request the current cookie value will be used. However, if
      the cluster cookie and the cookie of the host that is about to join
      the cluster doesn't match there will be a connection error.
