# While this model has different set of subclasses from StorageCreateDetails,
# both models are listed in "allOf" in the subclasses.
# By listing StorageCreateDetails there first and marking all fields as
# readOnly in this StorageGetDetails model, fields unique to GET
# are prevented from appearing in the generated Erlang code.
