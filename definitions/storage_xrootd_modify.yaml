      type: string
      description: >
        Type of the modified storage. Must be given explicitly and must match
        the actual type of subject storage - this redundancy is needed
        due to limitations of OpenAPI polymorphism.
      enum: [xrootd]
      x-discriminator-value: xrootd
    url:
      type: string
      description: >
        Full URL of the XRootD server, including scheme (root or http) and path, e.g.
        `root://192.168.0.1//data`. Please note, that XRootD URL format requires double
        slash after host to indicate absolute path.

      type: string
      description: >
        The credentials to authenticate with the XRootD server. For `pwd` credentials
        type, this field should contain simply user and password, e.g. `admin:password`.
        For `none` this field is ignored.

      type: string
      description: >
        Defines the file permissions mask, which is used to map XRootD file mode to POSIX
        mode. For instance a fileModeMask `0664` for readable file on XRootD would result
        in a file which is readable for all users, but file which is writeable in XRootD
        will be only writeable by user and group.

        Defines the file permissions mask, which is used to map XRootD file mode to POSIX
