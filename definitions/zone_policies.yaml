properties:
  oneproviderRegistration:
    type: string
    enum: [open, restricted]
    description: |
      Indicates policy enforced during provider registration. Possible options are:
      open - anyone can acquire a registration token and register a new Oneprovider
      restricted - requires an administrative privilege 'oz_providers_invite'
                   to generate a Oneprovider registration token. The token
                   can be issued for someone else.
  subdomainDelegation:
    type: boolean
    description: If true, Oneproviders are allowed to request subdomains
      of the Onezone domain for use as their domains.
  guiPackageVerification:
    type: boolean
    default: true
    description: >
      When this value is true, GUI packages uploaded by services operating under
      Onezone or by harvester admins are checked against known
      SHA-256 checksums using the compatibility registry. Setting this value
      to false disables the verification.

      WARNING: disabling GUI package verification poses a severe security
      threat, allowing Oneprovider owners to upload arbitrary GUI to Onezone
      (which is then hosted in Onezone's domain).
  harvesterGuiPackageVerification:
    type: boolean
    default: true
    description: >
      This policy can be used to disable GUI package verification for harvester
      plugins only. See "guiPackageVerification" for detailed description.

      This setting has no effect if "guiPackageVerification" is set to false.
example:
  subdomainDelegation: true
  guiPackageVerification: true
  harvesterGuiPackageVerification: false
