  Gathers results of DNS checks for various aspects of the cluster domain.

  Both Oneprovider and Onezone return field 'domain' for checking if cluster's domain
  can be resolved.

  In Onezone there is additional field 'dnsZone' for checking whether DNS zone management
  for the Onezone's domain has been delegated to Onezone server (SOA and NS records)
  allowing for subdomain delegation.

  If the cluster is configured with an IP neither 'domain' nor 'dnsZone' is returned.
properties:
  domain:
    $ref: '#/definitions/DnsCheckResult'
  dnsZone:
    $ref: '#/definitions/DnsCheckResult'
