        The type of storage.
        
        `type = "nulldevice"`
        
        POSIX compatible storage which emulates behavior of `/dev/null` on
        local filesystem. Allows running various performance tests, which are
        not impacted by actual storage latency.
      enum: [nulldevice]
      x-discriminator-value: nulldevice
    latencyMin:
      type: integer
      description: |
        Minimum latency in milliseconds, which should be simulated for
        selected operations.
    latencyMax:
      type: integer
      description: |
        Maximum latency in milliseconds, which should be simulated for
        selected operations.
    timeoutProbability:
      type: number
      format: float
      description: |
        Probability (0.0, 1.0), with which an operation should return
        a timeout error.
    filter:
      type: string
      description: |
        Comma-separated list of filesystem operations, for which latency
        and timeout should be simulated. Empty or '*' mean all operations
        will be affected.
    simulatedFilesystemParameters:
      type: string
      description: |
        Specifies the parameters for a simulated null device filesystem.
        For example `2-2:2-2:0-1` will generate a filesystem tree which has 2
        directories (`0` and `1`) and 2 files (`2` and `3`) in the root of
        the filesystem, each of these directories will have 2 subdirectories
        (`0` and `1`) and 2 files (`2` and `3`) and each of these
        subdirectories has only a single file (`0`). In order to specify the
        size of generated files, a size in bytes needs to be added as the last
        component of the parameter specification, for example `2-2:2-2:0-1:1048576`.
        Default empty string disables the simulated filesystem feature.
    simulatedFilesystemGrowSpeed:
      type: number
      format: float
      description: |
        Determines the simulated filesystem grow rate. Default 0.0 value
        will cause all the files and directories defined by the
        `simulatedFilesystemParameters` specification to be visible immediately.
        For example value of 0.01 will increase the number of the visible
        filesystem entries by 1 file per 100 seconds, while 100.0 will increase it
        by 100 files per second.
    enableDataVerification:
      type: boolean
      default: false
      description: |
        Enables data verification for `read` and `write` operations. Read operations
        will always return a predictable pattern of characters based on `offset` and
        `size`, and `write` operations will fail with I/O error, if the input data
        does not match the pattern at a given `offset`.
