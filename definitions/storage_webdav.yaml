            The credentials to authenticate with the WebDAV server. `basic` credentials
            should be provided in the form `username:password`, for `token` just the token.

      rangeWriteSupport:

        description: >
            The type of partial write support enabled in the WebDAV server. Currently 2
            types are supported `sabredav` which assumes the server supports the SabreDAV
            PartialUpdate extension via `PATCH` method, and `moddav` which assumes server
            supports partial `PUT` requests with `Content-Range` header. If `none` is
            selected no write support is available for this WebDAV storage.

        default: none
      connectionPoolSize:
        type: integer
        description: >
            Defines the maximum number of parallel connections for a single WebDAV storage.
        default: 10
      maximumUploadSize:
        type: integer
        description: >
            Defines the maximum upload size for a single `PUT` or `PATCH` request. If set to 0,
            assumes that the WebDAV server has no upload limit.

          direct IO mode.
      readonly:
        type: boolean
        default: false
        description: Defines whether storage is readonly.
      storagePathType:
        type: string
        default: canonical
        description: |
          Determines how the logical file paths will be mapped on the storage.
          'canonical' paths reflect the logical file names and directory structure,
          however each rename operation will require renaming the files on the storage.
          'flat' paths are based on unique file UUID's and do not require on-storage
          rename when logical file name is changed.
