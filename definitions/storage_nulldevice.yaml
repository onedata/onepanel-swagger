      latencyMin:
        type: integer
        description: |
            Minimum latency in milliseconds, which should be simulated for
            selected operations.
        default: 0
      latencyMax:
        type: integer
        description: |
            Maximum latency in milliseconds, which should be simulated for
            selected operations.

      timeoutProbability:
        type: number
        format: float
        description: |
            Probability (0.0, 1.0), with which an operation should return
            a timeout error.
        default: 0.0
      filter:
        type: string
        description: |
            Comma-separated list of filesystem operations, for which latency
            and timeout should be simulated. Empty or '*' mean all operations
            will be affected.
        default: "*"
      storagePathType:
        type: string
        default: canonical
        x-onedata-default-value: '<<"canonical">>'
        description: |
          Determines how the logical file paths will be mapped on the storage.
          'canonical' paths reflect the logical file names and directory structure,
          however each rename operation will require renaming the files on the storage.
          'flat' paths are based on unique file UUID's and do not require on-storage
          rename when logical file name is changed.
      simulatedFilesystemParameters:
        type: string
        default: ""
        description: |
          Specifies the parameters for a simulated null device filesystem.
          For example `2-2:2-2:0-1` will generate a filesystem tree which has 2
          directories (`0` and `1`) and 2 files (`2` and `3`) in the root of
          the filesystem, each of these directories will have 2 subdirectories
          (`0` and `1`) and 2 files (`2` and `3`) and each of these
          subdirectories has only a single file (`0`).
          Default empty string disables the simulated filesystem feature.
      simulatedFilesystemGrowSpeed:
        type: number
        format: float
        default: 0.0
        description: |
          Determines the simulated filesystem grow rate. Default 0.0 value
          will cause all the files and directories defined by the
          `simulatedFilesystemParameters` specification to be visible immediately.
          For example value of 0.01 will increase the number of the visible
          filesystem entries by 1 file per 100 seconds, while 100.0 will increase it
          by 100 files per second.
