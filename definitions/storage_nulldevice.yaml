        type: integer
        description: |
            Minimum latency in milliseconds, which should be simulated for
            selected operations.
        default: 0
      latencyMax:
        type: integer

      timeoutProbability:
        type: number
        format: float
        description: |
            Probability (0.0, 1.0), with which an operation should return
            a timeout error.
        default: 0.0
      filter:
        type: string
        description: |
            Comma-separated list of filesystem operations, for which latency
            and timeout should be simulated. Empty or '*' mean all operations
            will be affected.
        default: "*"

        description: Storage operation timeout in milliseconds.
      readonly:
        type: boolean
        default: false
        description: Defines whether storage is readonly.
      storagePathType:
        type: string
        default: "canonical"
        description: |
          Determines how the logical file paths will be mapped on the storage.
          'canonical' paths reflect the logical file names and directory structure,
          however each rename operation will require renaming the files on the storage.
          'flat' paths are based on unique file UUID's and do not require on-storage
          rename when logical file name is changed.
example:
  type: nulldevice
  name: Slow storage
  latencyMin: 250
  latencyMax: 750
  timeoutProbability: 0.1
  filter: "read,write,open"
  insecure: true
