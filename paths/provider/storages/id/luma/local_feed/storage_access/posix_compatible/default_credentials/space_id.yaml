  operationId: local_feed_get_default_posix_credentials
  summary: Lookup default posix credentials in local feed
  description: >
    Returns default storage credentials for the space supported by POSIX-compatible storage
    that are defined in local feed. GID will be used as a component of storage credentials
    for each member of the space. Both UID and GID will be used as to represent
    owner of the space directory on storage.
    Returns an error if the storage has a different LUMA feed than `local`.
    This endpoint is relevant **only for POSIX compatible storages**.
