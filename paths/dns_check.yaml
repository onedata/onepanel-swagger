  description: >
    Returns results of the last DNS check, verifying the validity
    of DNS configuration for cluster's domain.
    Unless 'forceCheck' flag is set, the results may be cached.

    no results are returned.

    Settings used for the check, ie. DNS servers used can be modified
    using the dns_check/configuration endpoint.
