description: |
  This is the RESTful API definition of Onepanel component of Onedata data management system [http://www.onedata.org].
  
  This API allows control and configuration of local Onedata deployment, in particular full control over the Onezone and Oneprovider services and their distribution on the local resources. 
  
  Onezone and Oneprovider components are composed of 3 types of services: **managers**, **databases** and **workers**. 
  
  Using this API each of these processes can be deployed, started and stopped on 
  a specified host in the local site, in the context of either Onezone or Oneprovider service. 
  
  The Onepanel API is structured to reflect that it can either be used to control Onezone
  or Oneprovider deployment, each Onedata component deployment has a separate Onepanel 
  instance. In order to make the API calls explicit, Onezone or Oneprovider specific
  requests have different paths, i.e.:
    * Onezone specific operations start with `/api/v3/onepanel/zone/...`
    * Oneprovider specific operations start with `/api/v3/onepanel/provider/...`
    * Common operations paths include `/api/v3/onepanel/users`, ``/api/v3/onepanel/hosts` and ``/api/v3/onepanel/tasks`

  The overall configuration of each component can be controlled by updating `/api/v3/onepanel/zone/configuration` and
  `/api/v3/onepanel/provider/configuration` resources.
  
  All paths listed in this documentation are relative to the base Onepanel REST API which is `/api/v3/onepanel`, 
  so complete URL for a request to Onepanel service is:
  
  ```
  http://HOSTNAME:PORT/api/v3/onepanel/...
  ```

  ## Authentication
  Onepanel supports only HTTP basic authentication, i.e. using `username` and `password`, which were set when creating users.
  
  Onepanel users can have 2 roles:
    * **admin** - Onepanel administrator, there can be multiple administrators and all have equal rights in terms of Onedata deployment management,
    * **regular** - this role allows manual creation of user accounts, using which users can login to Onezone service using HTTP Basic authentication without OpenID. This role makes sense only on Onepanel which manages Onezone deployment.
 
  The first user account which is created in Onepanel is always an `admin` account.
  
  ## API structure
  This API allows the management of 2 Onedata services, Onezone and Oneprovider, in terms of their distribution on the local site.
  The API allows management of all these components as well as monitoring of their current status.

  Each of these services is composed of the following components:
    * **Worker processes** - these are available under `/zone/workers` and `/provider/workers` paths,
    * **Databases instances** - each Onedata service stores it's metadata in a Couchbase backend which can be distributed on any number of nodes, these are available under `/zone/databases` and `/provider/databases` paths
    * **Cluster manager** - this is a process which controls other deployed processes in one site, these are availables under these are available under `/zone/managers` and `/provider/managers` paths

  Below are some example requests to Onepanel using cURL:
    
  **Create new user**
  ```bash
  curl -X POST -k -vvv -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "admin", "password": "Password1", "userRole": "admin"}' \
  https://172.17.0.6:9443/api/v3/onepanel/users
  ```

  **Add storage resource to provider**
  ```bash
  curl -X PUT -u admin:Password1 -k -vvv -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"NFS": {"type": "posix", "mountPoint": "/mnt/vfs"}}' \
  https://172.17.0.4:9443/api/v3/onepanel/provider/storages 
  ```

  **Add a new Onezone worker**
  ```bash
  curl -X PUT -u admin:Password1 -k -vvv -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"hosts": ["node1.p1.1.dev"]}' \
  https://172.17.0.4:9443/api/v3/onepanel/zone/workers 
  ```
